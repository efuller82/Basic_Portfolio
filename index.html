                        Firstly, I identify myself as the father of three beautiful children.  I have one boy and two girls and their names are Isaac (10), Zoe (4), and Ezra (18 mos). Their mother's name is Jessica and I am proud to say that I have been lucky enough to be married to her for nearly 11 years, and we have been in Austin for all of that time.

                       Leading up to the coding bootcamp that I'm currently enrolled in, I was in the service industry for the past 16 years, 11 of which were with Hyatt Regency Austin, and 8 of those years I led the Banquet Beverage department.  I tell people that I had the best bar job in Austin, and I firmly believe that.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I left a job and friends that I loved because I wanted to find an industy that would allow me to spend nights and weekends at home with my family, and I have a genuine joy for the challenge that is coding.  I look forward to forging the same kinds of relationships and love for my work that I enjoyed in my previous work.
